Here's the list of Nursery Rhymes:

*   Bah Bah BlackSheep
*   Which Came first, The Chicken or the Egg?
*   30 days hath
*   99 bottles of beer on the wall
*   One, Two, buckle my shoe
*   As I was going to Saint Ive's
*   One for the Money
*   This little Piggy
*   This Old Man

Note: Currently only in Javascript, please feel free to add other programming languages.Most of the solutions are the simplest way possible but give yourself a challenge and refactor, clean up, simplify or otherwise build it out.
Credit will be given to all contributors that submit pull requests. So Please add different Languages, or iterations!
